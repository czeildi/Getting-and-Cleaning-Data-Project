# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
For the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data course project

With the Samsung data in your working directory, run_analysis.R creates a tiny dataset, and writes it to the averages.txt file.

You can view averages.txt with 
```
tidydata <- read.table("averages.txt", header = TRUE)
```
in R.

Codebook.md in this directory describes the variables, and the transformations done to the data.
run_analysis.R is also commented within the file explaining each transformation.
